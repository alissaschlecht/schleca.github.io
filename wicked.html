			<p>
				This is a project I was assigned in the UX advanced course at HackerYou. The task was to explore a wicked problem with design thinking.
			</p>
      <p>
        There is no shortage of wicked problems to explore in the world, and choosing an issue was arguably the most difficult part of this project.
      </p>
      <p>
      I ultimately chose Foster Care because I felt overwhelmed and uneducated by the topic - I wanted to explore something that truly challenged me and that I had little to no knowledge in because I wanted to push my research and discovery skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I have previously worked with young people experiencing homelessness and many of their stories involved formal or informal foster care, I realized I knew almost nothing about their real experiences there. When my sister started fostering siblings, I was shocked to learn details about her experience that I would have never been able to guess.

			<h4 class="h4">Project scope</h4>
			<p>The document below is a synopsis of my exploration into the subject for a 4 week period. For a topic of this size, that amount of time really only scratches the surface, and my solutions ultimately reflect that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another caveat - I initially wanted to do this exploration in the context of Canada, but quickly discovered that until very recently, Canada has not tracked or gathered data on the national foster care system. While this problem is a wicked one in itself, I wanted to truly explore the experiences of the people involved in these spaces, and chose to switch the area of focus to the US, which has a more robust record of documentation for youth during and after care.
