          <h2>The original challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The original CatMe was the result of a 5 line code challenge where no rules
            applied except that there must not be more than 5 lines of code (not including
            script tags). In exactly 5 lines, CatMe offered you the ability to see what your
            spirit cat and its associated name would be. If you didnâ€™t like it, you could
            simply get a new one with the click of a button. CatMe utilized The Cat API and
            its assortment of GIFs.

        />
        <div className={styles['cat-content']}>
          <p>Here we have what appears to be half of a feline form in action, dubbed questionably accurately, 'Cleo-cat-ra'.</p>

          <h2>The new redesign</h2>
          <p>
            After living for three years in relative but aesthetically barren fame,
            I decided to give CatMe a facelift in order to honor the true glory of
            cats. Unfortunately I've now gone far over 5 lines of code (more than
            5 files even), but the payoff is hopefully in the joy of watching a cat rendered as a GIF
            through a tv, through another screen.
          </p>

        <img
          src={newCat} alt="New design for Cat Me"
          className={styles['cat-img']}
        />
        <div className={styles['cat-content']}>
          <p>While the first version claimed its bragging rights with 5 lines of code, the second version has been (perhaps overengineered) with React so that only the tv content refreshes with a new cat. Worth it!</p>
