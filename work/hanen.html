            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Brand friendliness / appearance</strong><br/>
               Hanen offers resources to everyone equally, but the perspective from many caregivers and parents is that most content is for professionals only, such as ‘member only content’. Hanen has such a huge amount of diversity in it’s products that finding a balance for the entire audience is challenging.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Site navigation</strong><br/>
              The high level needs of users are clear, but many people struggle to find the information on the website, both due to confusing navigation structures, a missing search feature, and unclear categories for specific subjects.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Event registration</strong><br/>
                The primary resource that Hanen offers are workshops - multi day, high ticket price, in person events that qualify an SLP to run a program on the same subject to parents. However, the registration, pre and post event experiences were confusing, difficult, and highly manual.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Content leads</strong><br/>
                One of the primary avenues for new leads to Hanen are through articles found by google searches. Some articles have very high popularity, but almost all have a bounce rate of 85% or more. In user testing, this was backed up when users reported feeling confused on where they were, or where to go next and opted to use the back button to google instead of exploring the site further.</p></li>

          <p>The Hanen Centre offers many diverse services, and there are many stakeholders working hard to continuously meet the needs of the users of those services. With that hard work comes strong opinions about what users want. A primary goal of this phase was to clearly establish who we were serving, what they wanted, and why they wanted those things - directly from the users themselves.</p>
          <p>The creation of personas and experience maps were instrumental later in the project to help refocus on who we were serving, and ask questions based on them, while allowing us to say "I don't know" and work to find better answers.</p>

          <p>In terms of process, we were still establishing our production and review mechanisms for design at this point. We started with two week sprints, but quickly found that one week per feature / milestone was more efficient and manageable.</p>

I ended up darkening the blue so we could use it with white and light gray, and setting strict designations for the secondary orange to only be used for non-essential highlights</p></li>
              <li><p>A major theme of the brand and web identity were clean, proffesional, and friendly - I think this came as a sort of communal reaction to the previous website, which was tight and difficult to read and navigate.</p></li>
              <li><p>The main navigation was a comprimise. While we were still using language that was clearly not connecting well with our users, the business was not ready to update the terminology. As a compromise, we included easy, clear descriptions at the first level of navigation in the mega-navs.</p></li>

            This is the place that our sprints truly started to shine in all their glory. We had worked out a lot of the kinks, easily jumped into whatever role we could help with, and had a clear and helpful review process.
          </p>
          <p>Because we were such a small team, all wearing so many hats, I really wanted user testing to be a main component of our design cycles - so that we could spend more time listening to what did and din't work, and less time in the murkey waters of our own opinions. It was a lofty goal, and often difficult to include in every iteration, but it is one of the things I think helped us stick to time and functionality goals, and gave the product a fighting chance at being helpful to it's users.</p>

              <li><p>One of the known future issues was that Hanen would never have a major budget for updates. With this in mind, I adopted the mindset of reuseability, so that many different sections could reuse the same types of components.</p></li>
              <li><p>We tried to incorporate as much user testing in this section as possible. Not everything when through a testing cycle with users, but we utalized the office staff as much as possible with A/B testing and user testing with InVision flows, and reached out to willing members and parents when we had big questions or high stakes features.</p></li>
              <li><p>I used a mixed set of tools for these prototypes, depending on what we needed to do. The bulk of everything (wireframing to high fidelity) was created in Figma, and some were built as HTML templates for presentations and testing.</p></li>

            As the design process was very underway, we had a hiccup with our development team, and lost our front-end. After months of struggling to replace the position, I volunteered to start building some of the designs out in HTML, with our backend developer there to start incorporating them in a CMS. The process ended up working really well, and more efficiently in terms of time to production. Unfortunately, my time in design, especially testing, took a signficant hit and a few features will need to have extra attention at release. Our real goal was to release something in a reasonable amount of time, and I think that goal is being met.

            This project is truly a mix of heavy, beuracractic rules shaking hands with the best agile processes it could muster. As a result of that, it is struggling to fully get it's boots off the ground and is not currently live. However, development is in the final stages, content is being reviewed, bugs are being collected and checked off Jira, and hope is in the air. It has a few administrative hoops to jump through before it's released into the wild, but it should be out there in the next couple of months.  Keep an eye out for Hanen.org.
