# Five_Line_Cat_Generator
CatMe is a the result of a 5 line code challenge where no rules apply except that there must not be more than 5 lines of code (not including script tags). In exactly 5 lines, CatMe offers you the ability to see what your spirit cat and its associated name would be. If you donâ€™t like it, you can simply get a new one with the click of a button. CatMe utilizes The Cat API and its assortment of GIFs.

There are many cats available on the internet, but perhaps never too many.
